Background and Objective:

We have Azure cost and usage data in data warehouse. 
This data can be lloked from different dimensions, such as Subscription, ResourceGroup, ServiceName, Provider, ResourceType and so on.
We have precomputed unique items along these dimensions as CETAS table in my warehouse. 
We have also pprecomputed certain aggregations such as monthly weekly and daily spend by one or more of the above dimensions, 
for example - daily cost by subscription, monthly cost by servicename and resourcegroup, monthly cost by service name and subscription, 
monthly and weekly costs by service name and servicename resourcegroup combination and so on. 

We need to create analytics dashboard to provide CFO with insights into cloud spending across these various dimensions and time windows.
While CFO doesn't have any particular view in mind, she will be interested in knowing things like how Cloud cost across different dev, test, and prod environments 
are trending over time, which areas they are spending most on, whether there are any anomalies or certain spike in certain spending and so on. 

We need a detailed plan for a dashboard with various widgets that will show such different viewpoints. 
The charts needs to be interactive, so that user can play around choosing various different filtering condition across dimensions and time windows, 
and easily spot the trends.

Plan:

3. Subscription cost comparison as a horizontal bar chart with multi-dropdown to select subscriptions and slider to adjust time window for rolling averages
4. Resource group spending patterns as a heatmap with dropdowns to select subscription and service name filters and date range picker for analysis period
5. Cost anomaly detection over time as a scatter plot with range inputs to set anomaly thresholds and dropdown to select dimension for analysis 
(service, resource group, subscription)
6. Top cost drivers by resource type as a stacked bar chart with multi-dropdown to select resource locations and slider 
to adjust number of top items displayed (5-20)
